# README_Generator

## Description

### **What was my motivation?**

    I needed to create an application for generating a professional README file.

### **Why did I build this project?**

    I built this project to better understand how to implement Node.js, JavaScript Objects, Switch Statements, and Function Dependency.

    This project creates an application to quickly generate a README with much of the formatting and questions already in place.

## Installation

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

- Installation can completed by forking and cloning this repository onto your desktop.

- Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

- Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

## Usage

This application can be run using the terminal with Node.js.<br/>Please see below for examples of a typical user through my application:
